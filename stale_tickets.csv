We want to calculate the *angle* at which the rays are hitting the flat cells over a period of time. This will then translate into the intensity of the suns rays which will allow for deciphering of how much energy the car is receiving.

As a next step, we want to measure total energy changes over time interval and different locations.

*Recommended Steps*

# Create dummy data for location changes (lat, long) in real-time over a specific time interval.
# Run a small simulation that would mimic how the current Solar Day class would handle different lat longs across a time interval.
# Calculate the angle that the sun rays are directly hitting the cells across time. (maybe create a CSV of angle changes across lat, long, and time differences)
# Research Item: What is the correlation of angle of approach vs intensity? Does the angle of approach of the sun’s rays affect the intensity and therefore the total energy received from the sun?
# With this information in mind, translate the angle changes of the car to the sun into total energy changes over time. 
# Make the lat, long, and time changes dynamic - can we set lat, long, and times and receive the same simulation results?

As an MVP, let’s focus on the “directness” angle of the solar rays to the car’s arrays. Assume the solar arrays are laid out flat in the car.

I.E.

# Angle of Approach for a Fixed Lat Long over a set time-interval
## Considering the Earth’s nature
